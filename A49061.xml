            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHereas in Order to the Re-building of the City, and before any further Progreſs can be effectually made in that moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Affair, it is of Abſolute Neceſſity, that a Iuſt Survey and Menſuration be had and taken of all Foundations of Houſes and other Buildings, deſtroyed in the late Diſmall Fire, for the ſtating and aſcertaining of every ones Intereſt and Propriety: And to the making of this Survey and Admeaſurement, it is as neceſſary that the ſaid Foundations be firſt made clear and naked from Rubbiſh, without which no Artiſt can perform this Service to every Mans right and juſt ſatisfaction; which hitherto, how earneſtly ſoever the ſame hath been preſſed and perſwaded by former Precepts, hath been almoſt totally neglected, to the great Diſcouragement of the Magiſtrates, and retarding of thoſe Proceedings, which otherwiſe by Gods Bleſſing, His Majeſties, and the Parliaments Favour and Aſſiſtance, and the Indeavours of good Citizens, had by this time far prevailed towards a beginning of this Work. Vpon all which, My Self, and my Brethren the Aldermen, with the Commons in Common Council Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſeriouſly reflecting, and withal conſidering what further Diſcouragements, Damages, and Inconveniencies, more Delayes and Loſs of Time may bring upon this Affair; which needs to be quickened and kept in heart by Speedy, Active, and Vigorous Management and Proſecution: Having alſo Adviſed how the ſaid Survey may be ſooneſt taken, and with moſt Eaſe, leaſt Charge, and fulleſt Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to every Proprietor; did Yeſterday the Ninth Day of this inſtant <hi>October,</hi> Agree a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Order:</p>

            <p>Secondly, That the ſaid Surveys and Admeaſurement of Foundations be preſently after ſuch Avoidance and Clearing of the Rubbiſh, and Pileing up of the Bricks and Stones, taken in hand, and carryed on with all Speed and Effect, by the Care and Management of Doctor <hi>Wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly; That there ſhall be allowed to the Surveyors who ſhall be aſſigned to every Ward, for the Survey and Meaſuring the ſaid Foundations, and to the Clerk and Beadle, or other that ſhall be appointed to attend them for the orderly and methodical entring and regiſtring the ſame Surveyes and Meaſures, <hi>viz.</hi> for every Foundation Eighteen pence, to be paid by every reſpective Proprietor, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betwixt the ſaid Surveyors, Clerks, and Beadles, or others, in ſuch proportion as ſhall be agreed and directed by the ſaid Vndertakers. Nor is any man to be grieved, that there is the ſame rate and allowance made for ſmall and leſſer Houſes, as there is for large and greater, conſidering that the trouble of Surveying and Regiſtring a ſmall Houſe, is upon the matter, if not altogether, one and the ſome, or as much as of a greater: And that the rate is in it ſelf ſo moderate and eaſie, that the leaſt Houſe without this care and proviſion, could not be Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed and Regiſtred, but at a much greater charge.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly, That when the Surveyors ſhall begin in every Ward, timely notice thereof be given by the Surveyors, that all Proprietors may attend to evidence and aſſert their own Ground and Intereſt.

            <p>I do therefore, by adviſe of my Brethren the Aldermen, hereby publiſh and declare the ſaid Orders made in Common Council for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerating and promoting of this great Concernment; requiring in His Majeſties Name, all perſons concerned to apply themſelves preſently to the cleering of the ſaid Rubbiſh, and in all other things to give their ready obedience to the ſaid Orders and Directions, as they wiſh the reſtauration of the City to its former State and Glory, and the preſervation of their own particular Right and Intereſt, (which muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuffer) and will anſwer the contrary at their uttermoſt perills.</p>
